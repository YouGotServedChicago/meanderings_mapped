## Description

Meanderings Mapped is an app to record travel journal entries.  Users can create profiles, list places they travelled to, and a journal entry or notes for each location.

## Technologies Used
* Sinatra
* SQL
* Javascript
* Ruby
* Ajax
* Google API
* Bootstrap

## Approach

Our approach to building the app was to determine its basic structure and then wireframe it.  After that, we began working on coding.  We worked on the basic structure of the site, while also working on the Google Places API Autocomplete feature.  Once we had both things working, we worked on the databases and security, while styling the site throughout the process.

## Unfinished Items
* Conversion of date of birth to age on profile page
* A second Google maps API call to add a location map for each journal entry
